# Countdown Timer

#### In this challenge you have to create timer using vanilla Javascript

You should create three input fields, for **hours, minutes and seconds** and **Start button**. 
Initial value of the inputs must be 0h 5m 0s. When user inputs **hours, minutes and seconds** and clicks **Start button** Countdown timer should start working, **Start button MUST BE hidden** and you should show **Pause, Stop
and Reset buttons**.<br>

When you click **Pause button** timer must be paused and Pause button text must be changed with **Resume**. 
When user clicks on **Resume button** countdown timer continues working and Resume text
changes into **Pause** again.
When you click **Stop**, timer must be stopped, and only single button **Start** must be displayed. The values of the inputs must be changed to 0h 5m 0s again.
When you click **Reset**, timer should start countdown process again from the values user entered.
For example: if user entered values 1hour 22minutes and 33seconds and clicked on Start button and after 10 seconds (when the timer shows 1hour 22minutes and 23seconds) user clicked on Reset, timer should start working from 1hour 22minutes and 33seconds again.

*Use bootstrap styling for inputs and buttons*
